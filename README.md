# IBM Student Depression Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
Using the Student Depression Dataset, I aim to explore specific patterns, such as the relationship between sleep duration and depression, the influence of dietary habits on mental state, and the impact of financial stress and workload on the risk of depression. This analysis is expected to provide clearer insights into what factors may influence a student's likelihood of experiencing depression.

## Insight & Finding
**Insights**
This analysis shows that psychological and external pressures have a much more significant impact on depression than lifestyle or logistical factors. The order of the most influential factors highlights that foundational issues like serious mental health concerns, academic pressure, and financial stress are the primary drivers, while daily habits like sleep duration and unhealthy eating have a relatively lower impact.

**Findings**
1. The Most Influential Factor is a Serious Symptom
The most important finding is that having suicidal thoughts ranked at the top. This is not just a trigger but an indicator that a person is already in a severe, high-risk depressive state. This finding emphasizes the critical need for immediate and professional intervention.

2. Academic and Financial Pressures Are Highly Dominant
Four of the top five factors (academic pressure, financial stress, decreased GPA, and excessive work/study hours) are closely related to academic and economic environments. This indicates that the burden of academic demands and financial instability are extremely strong sources of chronic stress within the analyzed population.

3. Quality is Less Influential Than Quantity
The number of courses taken ranked at the very bottom, far below satisfaction with learning and academic pressure. This suggests that the quality of the learning experience and the perceived stress are far more important than the sheer number of courses.

4. Lifestyle Factors Play a Role, but Are Not Primary
Although sleep duration and unhealthy eating are listed as factors, their lower ranking indicates that these may be more of a consequence of depression or a secondary trigger, rather than a primary cause when compared to psychological and external pressures.

## AI Support Explanation
I used an artificial intelligence (AI) called IBM Granite to help me work faster and get better analysis results. The AI's assistance on this project included:

1. Helping Create Code in Google Colab
I asked AI to write some programming code in Google Colab. This code was important for preparing and cleaning the data, as well as running the Random Forest model analysis. With the AI's help, I didn't have to write the code from scratch, making the process faster and more accurate.

2. Summarizing Analysis Results
After the analysis model was complete, I gave the results to IBM Granite. The AI then helped me create a concise and clear conclusion. The AI easily summarized the key points from the potentially complex data.

3. Finding Important Insights and Discoveries
This was the most valuable part. Based on the analysis results, I asked IBM Granite to find deeper insights and discoveries. For example, I knew that "academic pressure" was important, but the AI helped me understand why it's so influential and how it relates to other factors.

4. Providing Advice and Recommendations
Finally, IBM Granite helped me create sensible recommendations. Based on all the findings, the AI provided suggestions on what universities or healthcare services could do to help students with depression. These suggestions were directly connected to the data I found, making them more robust and targeted.
